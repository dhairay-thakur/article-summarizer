# article-summarizer

* A Cross Platform Application that takes the link to an article as input and automatically summarizes the article into 10 sentences, extracts relevant images from it, and overlays a relevant sentence of the summary on the major image in the article.
* Once the Overlayed image is generated, it can be shared as an Instagram Story directly from the application.
* The API used by the application is built using Flask, making use of libraries such as `sumy`, `wand`, `newspaper`, and `requests`, which is deployed on heroku ([https://article-summarize.herokuapp.com/api](https://article-summarize.herokuapp.com/api))
* The Frontend is built using React Native.
